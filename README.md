# DNA-size-finder
## Overview
DNA size finder is a lightweight Java application that automates the analysis of microscopic images of DNA fiber data. It provides an easy to use environment where the user can use many different modes for analysis. It was developed in the Institute of Molecular Biology of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.
## How to setup for users
The application DNA size finder is extremely easy to setup. The only requirement is that there is a **Java Version 14.02 or higher** installed on the computer. Java can be downloaded from here (Link to the latest Java to download):

https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows

After this step is complete the folder ReadyToUse can be downloaded. In this folder there is the jar file which is the application that should be launched and a settings folder where pre-created settings for the program to use are stored. DNA size finder creates folders to work with only in the directory where it is located, so it is **recommended to keep the jar file in a separate folder**.
